# 📊 21 Days of SQL Challenge – Indian Data Club

This repository documents my journey through the **21 Days of SQL Challenge** led by **Indian Data Club**, and sponsored by **DPDzero**.

I’m revisiting SQL from the ground up — focusing on writing cleaner queries, understanding data better, and building a consistent daily learning habit.
